<b>JSON</b> (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
<p>JSON is built on two structures:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized
    as an <i>object</i>, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or
    associative array.</li>
  <li>An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an <i>array</i>,
    vector, list, or sequence.</li>
</ul>
